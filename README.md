# PurpleBall
This is just a gambling game I am working on after my first few weeks in the MIT boot camp for JS

# Description
I wanted to try and create something fun and fair for me and my friends to play in lieu of card games such as poker.
It is created with a random number generator that makes this game completely fair and uncheatable.
The idea is for the player to pick one of two spheres, either red or blue.
If your choice is successful as winner, you win your bet.

# Game Rules
-All Players equally input agreed starting bet wage into "Pot"
-First player in rotation will place a bet of equal or lessser value than current Pot value
-Player picks a color to win by pressing it first
-Player picks a color to lose by pressing it second
-If Player's first button pushed is higher than second button pushed - Player wins his bet from Pot and turn is over
-If Players first button pushed is lower than second button pushed - Player loses his bet to the Pot and turn is over
-CATCH: If on any Player's turn, BOTH spheres touch or surpass the boundary (white rectangle) - Player loses his bet to the Pot and turn is over
-Spheres may touch boundary on left side if sphere value is low as well, which still counts as touching or surpassing the boundary
-Game Ends when Pot is emptied or all but 1 Player runs out of money
-If by some miracle both of Player's spheres are the EXACT same value, the ball will be completely purple - Player auto wins Pot

# Usage
Currently made for desktop only. To play, just drag index.html file to your browser tab. It is a one file program.

# Future
The first thing I want to change in the future would be adding sound for the button clicks and when sphere collides with white rectangle barrier.
