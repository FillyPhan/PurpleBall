              <br/>
            -All Players equally input agreed starting bet wage into "Pot"<br/>
            -First player in rotation will place a bet of equal or lessser value than current Pot value<br/>
            -Player picks a color to win by pressing it first<br/>
            -Player picks a color to lose by pressing it second<br/>
            -If Player's first button pushed is higher than second button pushed - Player wins his bet from Pot and turn is over<br/>
            -If Players first button pushed is lower than second button pushed - Player loses his bet to the Pot and turn is over<br/>
            -CATCH: If on any Player's turn, BOTH spheres touch or surpass the boundary (white rectangle) - Player loses his bet to the Pot and turn is over<br/>
            -Spheres may touch boundary on left side if sphere value is low as well, which still counts as touching or surpassing the boundary <br/>
            -Game Ends when Pot is emptied or all but 1 Player runs out of money<br/>
            -If by some miracle both of Player's spheres are the EXACT same value - Player auto wins Pot<br/>
